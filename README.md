# InfoWorld RSS Feed Generator

This code will allegedly create an RSS feed of my articles at InfoWorld. It was written by Claude Opus in response to my prompts seeking code to create an RSS feed for my InfoWorld articles using GitHub Actions. Alas Claude preferred to write this in JavaScript instead of R, so I went with that. ðŸ˜… This should update every Thursday at 8 AM Eastern Time.

**There are oddly a couple of article in there showing me as the author that aren't actually my articles, sorry.** Working on that. 

## ðŸ“¡ Accessing the RSS Feed

In theory, anyone can access the RSS feed at: [https://smach.github.io/sharon-infoworld-rss/feed.xml](https://smach.github.io/sharon-infoworld-rss/feed.xml)


## ðŸ“± Adding to RSS Readers

You can add the feed URL to your favorite RSS reader:

- **Feedly**: Add the URL as a new source
- **Inoreader**: Add subscription â†’ Enter URL
- **NewsBlur**: Add Site â†’ Enter URL
- **The Old Reader**: Add subscription â†’ Enter URL
